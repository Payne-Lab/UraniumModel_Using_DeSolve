# UraniumModel_Using_DeSolve
Uses the "desolve" package in R to solve the model differential equations, instead of solving using a system of equations like Kims Uranium Box model.

Heres the link to the .R file containing output from 50,000k model runs in case you dont have time to run lots of models
It might take a bit to download, its about 1 gigabyte in size
